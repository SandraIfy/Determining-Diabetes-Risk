*Swilk tests pvalues were all <0.001 and plots are skewed, but sample size is large enough so we assume CLT

Part 2 

*Is there difference in mean plasma glucose conc in participants that have diabetes and do not have diabetes?
*Variable of interest: mean plasma glucose conc 
*Parameter of interest: Difference in mean plasma glucose conc between diabetes and non diabetes partcipants
*Test statistic- We conduct a 2 sided 2-sample t-test of means with equal or unequal variances, but first we have to determine if the variances are equal 
*Using alpha=0.05 and df=1006,492
*Hnull= Variances are equal  Halt= Variances are not equal 
*Decision factor: If pvalue < 0.05 variances are unequal If pvalue>0.05 variances are equal

Performing an f test for equal variance with CI 95% to determine if diabetes and non diabetes participants have equal mean variance for plasma glucose concentration
~~~~
<<dd_do>>
sdtest plasgluc, by(dm)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~
*Pvalue < 0.05, Therefore we reject the null, Variances are unequal, so we use 2 indpendent sample ttest with unequal variances

Next we conduct a 2 independent sample t-test of  with unequal variance, using degrees of freedom 872.6 
Hnull : mean plasma glucose difference=0, Halternative : mean plasma glucose difference= /0
~~~~
<<dd_do>>
ttest plasgluc, by(dm) unequal
<</dd_do>>
~~~~
Pvalue <0.05 and CI does not inlcude 0, so we reject null and conclude there is a difference in plasma glucose conc between diabetes and non diabetes participants. 
Also, we can conclude that diabetes group has greater mean plasma glucose concentration than the non-diabetes group

The histogram plots for residuals did not follow the normal curve, they resembled a right skewed distribution 
The q-q plots did not have most of the data points on the line, instead the points followed a curve across the regresion line 
Shapiro wilk test results for normality of residuals gave pvalue <0.001 for unadjusted, studentized and standardized residuals. Normality assumption is not satisfied
For homoscedasticity and linearity assumptions, we examined the residual scatter plot fitted against outcome variable insulin2h 
We can see that most of the data points closely follow the diagonal regression line, meaning linearity assumption is satisfied 
Homoscedasticity is also satisfied since there is no obvious pattern around the regression line
Finally, the Independence assumption was checked using the list command to see if each observation was indepednent of the other. The assumption is satisfied since there is no indication of paired or matched observations
